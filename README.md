# Declining student numbers in Pharmaceutical Sciences
Analysis of enrollment and graduation trends over the past 9 years in Flanders, using PostgreSQL for data processing and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard.

### Project overview
This project investigates the declining enrollment numbers in Pharmaceutical Sciences programs in Flanders, Belgium. While working at the University of Leuven, fewer students were entering (and graduating) the program each year, and I wanted to explore whether this trend was limited to the University of Leuven or a more general trend encountered by all universities.

Using publicly available datasets, I combined, cleaned, and analyzed data in PostgreSQL before visualizing insights in Power BI. The aim is to identify key trends and compare the various institutions to one another.
